2. [Simple Channel](https://github.com/venu-prasath/go-concurrency-patterns/tree/main/unbufferedChannels)

3. [Select Pattern](https://github.com/venu-prasath/go-concurrency-patterns/tree/main/unbufferedChannels)

4. [For Select Pattern](https://github.com/venu-prasath/go-concurrency-patterns/tree/main/bufferedChannels)

5. [Done Channel Pattern](https://github.com/venu-prasath/go-concurrency-patterns/tree/main/bufferedChannels)

6. [Basic Pipeline Pattern](https://github.com/venu-prasath/go-concurrency-patterns/tree/main/pipelines)
